This guide is intended to make the YAYA programming language accessible to more people. Whether you're completely new to programming and need to learn the basics of computer science, or you're experienced in programming but new to YAYA, or even if you have some experience in YAYA and want to learn more advanced features, I hope this guide will have something for you.

I have run this guide past a few people to check for errors and ensure things are explained clearly. But if you find something confusing, or an error of any kind, do reach out and I will clarify and/or update the guide.

This guide is up to date with YAYA Tc571-3. If you want to read more about YAYA from the official source, check out [AYAYA](http://emily.shillest.net/ayaya/index.php). There are a couple of [guides](https://emily.shillest.net/ayaya/index.php?%E3%83%9E%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A5%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB/%E6%96%87%E6%B3%95) there, including [one specifically for beginners](https://emily.shillest.net/ayaya/index.php?%E3%83%9E%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A5%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB/%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC) that just want to know the basics. You'll notice that it's entirely in Japanese, which is part of the reason I'm making this guide. It can be very difficult to understand programming concepts when run through a translator.

I will include boxes of sample code throughout this guide. I encourage you to copy sample code into Notepad++ (or your editor of choice) with the language set to C, so that you can see the syntax highlighting. They'll look like this:

```c
request
{
	"Hello, world!"
}
```

(In Notepad++, you can change the language by clicking on the language tab at the top. Then go to the C category, and click C.)

You can also download the companion ghost that goes with this guide, and click the links under each of the code boxes to run the code in the ghost and see the output. I also highly encourage you to look inside that ghost's files and play with the code examples in there, and see what you can make happen! All the code for each lesson will be separated into different files, and extra copies of the original code will be available so that you can undo any changes.

All that being said, I hope you have fun learning about YAYA! As a programming language it has some very strange features. But it is well adapted for creating ghosts, and a lot of the core concepts you learn here can be applied to other programming languages as well.
