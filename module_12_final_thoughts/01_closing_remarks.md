And that's the end of this YAYA course! I hope it was helpful to you. I highly recommend rereading any portions that you're not so sure about, and I always welcome questions. You can also look at the [AYAYA wiki's guide](https://emily.shillest.net/ayaya/index.php?%E3%83%9E%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A5%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB/%E6%96%87%E6%B3%95) to YAYA's syntax. If my way of wording things and my examples didn't make sense for you, then maybe theirs will! Even though I always have to run it through a machine translator, it's been a very helpful resource for me.

YAYA is a rather simple language with a few strange quirks, but I have found it to be very powerful for ghost making once you get used to it.

Please let me know if you found any issues in my guide, whether it be typos, unclear explanations, or errors in the information. I want to be spreading good information so more people know about how YAYA actually works, so I am happy to smooth out any issues to bring about a better understanding.

Happy coding!
