# YAYA_Fundamentals
 Complete guide to the YAYA programming language

This repository is for my WIP guide to YAYA. If you have access, congrats! I trust you enough to beta-read a project that is very important to me. You're welcome to submit issues here on GitHub, or DM me on Discord. I just figure it'll be easier to push changes here and keep everyone up to date that way.

I would really appreciate _all_ feedback, I want this guide to be as accurate and clear as possible. If the wording seems confusing, if it seems like I'm going too in-depth about something obscure, if I haven't explained something enough, if I've explained a concept inaccurately, or even if I've just misspelled something, please please please let me know. It is very important to me that this guide be an accurate tool for folks who want to learn.

In the future, this repository will probably be used to track any changes made to the guide over time.

Oh yes, there will eventually be a companion ghost for this guide, but I can't set that up until the guide is complete, so. Coming Eventually!â„¢
