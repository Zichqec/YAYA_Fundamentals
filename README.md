# YAYA_Fundamentals
 Complete guide to the YAYA programming language

This repository is for my WIP guide to YAYA. If you have access, congrats! I trust you enough to beta-read a project that is very important to me. You're welcome to submit issues here on GitHub, or DM me on Discord. I just figure it'll be easier to push changes here and keep everyone up to date that way.

I would really appreciate _all_ feedback, I want this guide to be as accurate and clear as possible. If the wording seems confusing, if it seems like I'm going too in-depth about something obscure, if I haven't explained something enough, if I've explained a concept inaccurately, or even if I've just misspelled something, please please please let me know. It is very important to me that this guide be an accurate tool for folks who want to learn.

The formatting used in these text files is not complete, as I plan to replicate this guide in multiple places which each have their own formatting needs. I've used Discord's markdown formatting to indicate italics and bold, and any links in the text will be applied to appropriate words.

In the future, this repository will probably be used to track any changes made to the guide over time.
